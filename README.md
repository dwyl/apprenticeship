# dwyl apprenticeship

Everything you need to know about
dwyl's creative technology apprenticeship!

## Why?

_Most_ companies/organisations only (_want to_) hire
people who _already_ have "_years_" of experience
and not _invest_ in training `new` people.

On the _surface_ it can be _tempting_ to only
hire "_experienced_" people for technical teams;
after all someone _else_ has paid for their past "mistakes"
and they have practiced their craft for "_years_",
so they are more likely to get the work done faster, right?


### Our

At dwyl we hypothesize that it's _more effective_
to train people _from scratch_
because of the following reasons:
+ Gives people who are new to the industry a start.
+ Avoids bad habits (_like un-tested or un-documented work!_)
+ Instills the habit of continuous learning _early_
in the person's journey thus avoiding "_senior syndrome_"
(_where people feel they already know everything!_)
+ New people tend to have a ["beginners mind"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin)
and are more "_teachable_"
+ more likely to pass on their knowledge to teammates (_whereas most "senior" people "hoard" their knowledge our of fear of being replaced!_)
