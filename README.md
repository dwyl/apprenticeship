Everything<sup>1</sup> you need to know about
dwyl's Apprenticeship in Creative Technologies ("ACT").

</div>

> <sup>1</sup>Our aim is to capture the answers
to _all_ Questions in this repository. <br />
If you have any unanswered questions
or _anything_ is unclear,
please open an [issue](https://github.com/dwyl/apprenticeship/issues).


## Why?

_Most_ companies/organisations only (_want to_) hire
people who _already_ have "_years_" of experience
and not _invest_ in training `new` people.
In the worst cases we've seen
companies demand 2-3 years experience
for a _junior_ person which is like a kindergarten
expecting a 5 year old to know calculus.

On the _surface_ it can be _tempting_ to only
hire "_experienced_" people for technical teams;
after all someone _else_ has paid for their past "mistakes"
and they have practiced their craft for "_years_",
so they are more likely to get the work done faster, right?

>

### Our Hypothesis

At dwyl we hypothesize that it's _more effective_
to train people _from scratch_
because of the following reasons:
+ Gives people who are new to creative tech a start.
+ Avoids bad habits (_like un-tested or un-documented work!_)
+ Instills the habit of continuous learning _early_
in the person's journey thus avoiding "_senior syndrome_"
(_where people feel they already know everything!_)
+ New people tend to have a
["beginners mind"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin)
and are more "_teachable_".
+ More likely to pass on their knowledge to teammates
(_whereas most "senior" people "hoard" their
knowledge our of fear of being replaced!_)

## What

**1 - 16 months** of ***intensive learning***
covering several areas including:

### Personal Effectiveness

Tracking managing your time/energy to ensure you are applying yourself.
_Most_ people don't use their time very effectively
and wonder why they never have time for _anything_.


### Creativity

Creativity is the use of imagination or ideas to create something.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity <br />
Creativity is central to everything we do @dwyl
and we are all _constantly_ being creative.

If you _already_ feel that you are creative
and want a chance to develop your ideas and creative skills,
please get in contact!
We need creative people who want to _make_ things!

On the other hand,
if you (_currently_) believe
that people are either _born_
with creativity or they are _not_
and that creativity _cannot_ be learned,
be prepared to have your mind thoroughly changed!

### Communication

+ [x] **Asking questions**!
If you aren't asking questions you aren't learning. It's really _that_ simple.
+ [x] **Writing** - capturing _everything_ you learn.
Enhancing/improving/editing @dwyl's _extensive_ library
of learning guides and tutorials.
+ [x] **Visual** communication including graphics and video.

### Collaboration

How to work with other people in a team both in-person and remote.


### UX/Design Thinking



### Code

We think _everyone_ should learn how to (read/write/understand) code
because it teaches you to think systematically
and break down problems into small chunks.

@dwyl we write code to make useful things for real people. <br />
<!-- We don't write code for hedge funds and high frequency traders
to [help rich people get richer](https://youtu.be/_HDFegpX5gI). -->
We do not expect that _all_ the people
doing the Apprenticeship to write code.
In fact we expect people to gravitate
to the area of creativity they most enjoy
and is most fulfilling/valuable to them.
In the same way that reading, writing and math
is required in all schools
(_an is widely considered to be "basic literacy"_)
we feel that _knowing_ how to code is _essential_.

In the same way that not _all_ people
who are learning to code
as part of primary school curriculum
in schools will write code for a living.

Along the way you
_use_ technology to leverage your creativity
***building*** technology products
with _great_ UX and code quality!
