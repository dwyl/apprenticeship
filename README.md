Everything<sup>1</sup> you need to know about
dwyl's Apprenticeship in Creative Technologies ("ACT").

> <sup>1</sup>Our aim is to capture
the answers to _all_ questions
relating to the apprenticeship
in this repository. <br />
If you have any unanswered questions
or _anything_ is unclear,
_please_ open an [issue](https://github.com/dwyl/apprenticeship/issues)! <br />
We _know_ this repo not perfect and we _need_ your help to make it better.

<!--
@dwyl we have _not yet_ figured out _all_ things.
We consider ourselves to be a
[learning organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_organization)
and our _speed_ of learning
(_and sharing knowledge_)
is our "_super power_"!
We are all learning new things every day
and that is why it's _vitally_ important
that _everyone_ shares _everything_
they learn to maximise the rate
of _collective_ learning.
-->


## _Why_?

_Most_ companies/organisations only (_want to_) hire
people who _already_ have _years_ of experience.
Managers rationalise
that it's too expensive and time-consuming
to _invest_ in training people
who have little or _zero_ work experience.
On the _surface_ it can be _tempting_ to only
hire _experienced_ people for technical teams;
after all someone _else_ has paid for their past mistakes (_learning_).
Experienced people have practiced their craft for _several years_,
so they are more likely to get the work done faster, _right_?
_Evidence_ suggests it makes a _lot more_ sense
to have a _mix_ of _both_ experienced
and people with a fresh perspective on a team.

<!--
### Why Diversity is Essential in _All_ Systems

A forest is not just mature trees.
It has both established trees
and new seedlings.
Biodiversity and _sharing_ resources
is _essential_ for a thriving ecosystem
with
[ecological succession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecological_succession).
The most familiar/popular example
of having a range of experience
is a _professional_ sports team.
Successful sports teams
are _never_ homogeneous
in age or experience; there is always a _range_.
There are _always_ more experience
players teamed with newer less experienced ones.
Youth System:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_system
-->

The purpose of @dwyl's Apprenticeship
is to help people
gain real-world experience
while developing the skills
necessary to operate effectively in the
[creative industries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_industries).
Our objective is to give people the _opportunity_
to learn creative, communication,
teamwork and technical skills in a real world environment.
<!-- Obviously we would not put a person
with _zero_ experience/knowledge
on a team to work on a tough project.
In the same way that new recruits in the army
are not sent directly to the front lines without training! -->





### Our Hypothesis

At dwyl we hypothesize that it's _more effective_
to train people _from scratch_
because of the following reasons:
+ It gives people who are new to creative tech a start
they would not otherwise get.
  + Getting a _start_ in creative tech is the _hardest_ part.
  @dwyl will help you _leap_ over the first barrier.
+ People who are `new` tend to have a
["beginners mind"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin)
and are more "_teachable_".
+ Avoids bad habits (_like un-tested or un-documented work!_).
+ Instills the _habit_ of continuous learning _early_
in the person's journey thus avoiding "_senior syndrome_"
(_where people feel they already know everything!_)
+ More likely to pass on their knowledge to teammates
(_whereas most "senior" people "hoard" their
knowledge our of fear of being replaced!_)

## _What_?

An **apprenticeship** is a **system** of training people
who are **learning** how to do a job which needs **special skill**. <br />
see:
[wikipedia.org/wiki/Apprenticeship](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apprenticeship)

***ACT*** is an ***intensive learning*** program
covering several areas that are relevant
to working the creative industries.
Some of the skills are "life skills"
that are _essential_ for operating effectively
both as an individual and as a member of a team in any organisation.
Other skills are technical and _specific_ to a particular role in a team.
We encourage _everyone_ to learn the fundamentals in _all_ skills
before choosing their preferred ones to _master_.

Some of the skills include:

### 1. Personal Effectiveness

[@dwyl's mission](https://github.com/dwyl/start-here/blob/master/mission.md#what-is-dwyls-mission)
is to
"_Empower people to maximise effectiveness, creativity and happiness._" <br />
Maiximizing your personal effectiveness
is the _first_ step toward achieving your potential.
Our [App](https://github.com/dwyl/app)
which you will _contribute_ to during the ACT
is designed to help you build and track the habits
necessary for creative excellence.
There are _many_ ways you can contribute
way more than designing UX or writing code!
For now simply focus on the fact that you
will be improving your personal effectiveness
in a _systematic_ way.
Tracking and managing your time/energy
to ensure you are applying yourself
and working on the tasks that actually
move you toward your goal(s).



### 2. Creativity

Creativity is the use of imagination or ideas to create something.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creativity <br />
Creativity is central to everything we do @dwyl
and we are all _constantly_ being creative.
There are _many_ ways of being creative,
the first step is simply to _think_
that you _can_ be creative!
If you _already_ feel that you are creative
and want a chance to develop your ideas and creative skills,
please get in contact!
We need creative people who want to _make_ things!

If you are stuck thinking you are _not_ creative,
we suggest
[dwyl/**learn-creativity**](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-creativity/issues/7)
as a starting point.

### 3. Communication

One of the most valuable transferrable skills
anyone can learn and _apply_ to any area of their life/work
is _communication_.


+ [x] **Asking questions**!
If you _aren't_ asking questions you aren't learning. It's really _that_ simple.
+ [x] **Writing** - capturing _everything_ you learn.
Enhancing/improving/editing @dwyl's _extensive_ library
of learning guides and tutorials.
+ [x] **Sharing** what you are thinking
_especially_ when you see an area for improvement!
+ [x] ***Informing*** your teammates what you are working on
by consistently updating the task tracker
(_e.g: with update comments on a GitHub issue_)
has multiple benefits which compound over time.
+ [x] **Visual** communication including graphics and ***video***.

### 4. Collaboration

        <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/71603902-fc66d180-2b56-11ea-8bac-8486990e9ef3.png" width="800">
    </a>
</div>

How to work with other people in a team both in-person and remote.
This is an incredibly valuable transferrable life skill
that everyone should master.
See: https://github.com/dwyl/remote-working


### 5. UX/Design Thinking



You don't have to _label_ yourself as a "designer" or go to college for 4 years
in order to _think_ like a designer. You just have to _observe_ the world
and think: "_is this **user-friendly**?_"

![steve-jobs-design-is-how-it-works](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/72974694-5f026480-3dc7-11ea-9d82-e89165f48d49.jpg)

There are plenty of examples of both good and bad design around us.
You have the _opportunity_ to improve the world
and the experience of your fellow humans through design.
What can be more _exciting_ than that?

### 6. Code

#### “_Everybody should learn to program a computer, <br />because it teaches you how to think._” ~ Steve jobs

We think _everyone_ should learn how to (read/write/understand) code
because it teaches you to think systematically
and break down problems into small chunks.

[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/71601935-a6416080-2b4d-11ea-9ad9-70bd5ada490e.png "Photo by Kevin Ku")](https://unsplash.com/photos/w7ZyuGYNpRQ)

@dwyl we write code to make useful things for real people. <br />
<!-- We don't write code for hedge funds and high frequency traders
to [help rich people get richer](https://youtu.be/_HDFegpX5gI). -->
We do not expect that _all_ the people
doing the Apprenticeship to write code for their _career_.
In fact we expect people to gravitate
to the area of creativity they most enjoy
and is most fulfilling/valuable to them.
In the same way that reading, writing and math
is required in all schools
(_an is widely considered to be "basic literacy"_)
we feel that _knowing_ how to code is _essential_.

<!--
In the same way that not _all_ people
who are learning to code
as part of primary school curriculum
in schools will write code for a living.
-->

#### “_Whether you want to uncover the secrets of the universe, or you just want to pursue a career in the 21st century, basic computer programming is an essential skill to learn_.” ~ Stephen Hawking

Along the way you
_use_ technology to leverage your creativity
***building*** technology products
with _great_ UX and code quality!



## Who?

Anyone _**over 18** years old_<sup>1</sup>
who has
***either*** not worked in creative tech before
before and wants to get started,
***or*** people that have worked in tech
and want to explore a different path.

The apprenticeship is for self-motivated people
who are eager to **learn _fast_ and _make_ things**! <br />
If you are _not already_ motivated
to learn _independently_,
please
[do _not_ apply](https://github.com/nelsonic/nelsonic.github.io/issues/318)
to ACT
until you learn to
[_apply_ yourself](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/267667/apply-yourself).


> <small><sup>1</sup>The reason for **minimum age**
for ACT is simple:
we don't want anyone quitting (regular) school,
[running](https://www.quora.com/Did-people-actually-used-to-run-away-and-join-the-circus-And-do-they-still-do-so-now)
[away](https://www.wikihow.com/Run-Away-With-the-Circus)
from their parents home
and showing up on our doorstep!
We _encourage_ anyone/everyone
_under_ age 18 to start their creative tech learning journey
as soon as possible!
But _definitely_ "stay in school"
and learn everything you can,
because life it's much easier
if you tick the box of "school" first.
If you are still in high school
and feel that your creativity
is _not_ being rewarded,
don't worry or lose hope,
it will be soon enough! </small>

## Frequently Asked Questions & _Answers_!


### Q: How long is a day?
[asked by @ZooeyMiller in #2](https://github.com/dwyl/apprenticeship/issues/2)

You should aim to spend **6 hours** per day on _deep work_.<sup>1</sup>
You are responsible for managing/tracking your time.
Divide your time between learning, researching, writing, coding, editing
and other creative work.
Aim to **start** your day no later than **08:50 GMT**
so that you are always "on time"
for the daily morning meeting.

If you are prefer to start earlier, do it!
Some of us start our day at 06:00 so we get 3h
of focus time *before* 09:00!
Just let someone know you are available/online
and remember to track your time so you don't over-work.

Six hours either sounds like _little_
(_if you are used to working 12h per day at a minimum wage job_),
or a _lot_ if you have attempted to _focus_ without distractions for 6 hours.
You are _not_ expected to work _continuously_ for 6 hours.
You _are_ expected to keep _track_ of your time

> <sup>1</sup>If you haven't yet read the book **Deep Work** by Cal Newport
make it a priority to read it and understand all the concepts
***before*** starting the ACT.


### Q: How to _Communicate_?


1. **GitHub** - GitHub is our
[single source of truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth).
We have a _strong_ preference for communicating via GitHub.
This ensures that _anyone_ can see what everyone _else_ is learning
or working on and can _help_ when we get stuck.
If in doubt, open an issue in the repository you are working on.


2. Daily Standup Meetings - We have a
[daily standup meeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting)
at **09:00** each day of the work week (_Monday - Friday_) <br />
_Everyone_ attends via **Zoom** video conference:
https://zoom.us/j/3371337133 <br />
Join the call at **08:59**.

> We keep our individual updates _brief_.
The point is just to describe in a few words what
you worked on the _previous_ day
and what your plan is for _today_.
We mention an issue number and project name e.g: <br />
"_Yesterday I worked on Autocomplete issue
[#224](https://github.com/dwyl/app/issues/224).
I realised that there is more work to do
before Autocomplete can work,
so today I am working on Basic tagging
[#245](https://github.com/dwyl/app/issues/224)_"

> If you are _stuck_ with the task
you are _currently_ working on,
make that clear by writing a **comment**
in the issue you are working on
and draw people's attention to it in the standup.

If for any reason you are _unable_ to attend the daily standup,
send a message with your update on the **@dwyl** Signal channel.


3. Signal - We use signal messenger https://signal.org
to _coordinate_ and ask "_logistical_" questions.
Signal is ephemeral so we _never_ use it
to ask technical questions,
those are _always_ asked/answered on GitHub
so that they're indexed by Google
and thus helpful to _everyone_.



### Q: How long is the apprenticeship?
[asked by @ZooeyMiller in #2](https://github.com/dwyl/apprenticeship/issues/2)

Initially for **8 weeks**. <br />
Progress should be reviewed _weekly_. (_we need a system for this ..._) <br />
<!--
If both **you** and **we** (_the core @dwyl team member mentoring you_)
feel you are making good progress,
the apprenticeship can be extended.
-->
More details in the Apprenticeship Agreement.


### Q: What is a "Previous Contribution" to a @dwyl Project?

Contribution to a dwyl project can range from:
+ **Asking** a question (_seeking clarification_) in a GitHub Issue.
+ **Answering** a question on an _existing_ issue.
+ **Reporting** a bug/issue on one of our projects or tutorials
+ **Creating** a Pull Request that _fixes_ the bug/issue you reported
and or adds the question/answer to a relevant readme.

<!--
### Q: How/when/how much do we get paid?

People based in London are paid "London Living Wage".
Weekly.
-->


### Q: What are the Potential _Outcomes_ of the Apprenticeship?

There are four potential outcomes
ranging from disappointment to _delight_.

1. ***`Nothing`*** -
people who do _not_ put in the _daily effort_
will inevitably have _no outcome_. <br />
This is just a fact: “_Nothing will work unless you do_.” ~ Maya Angelou <br />
Do not fall into the trap of doing nothing and expecting miracles.
Ask questions every day. Learn continuously and _share_ your knowledge.
Trust that persistence is the key to success.

2. **Job** with another org/company (_recommendation from @dwyl_) -
once you are confident in your skills and have a portfolio of work,
we _encourage_ everyone to _apply_ for a job that you _want_ to do.

3. **Job** with @dwyl -
If you consistently go the extra mile to share what you learn,
ask/answer questions and contribute to the @dwyl projects/product,
you will be invited to become a core team member.
For now just focus on learning and sharing what you learn.

4. **Start Up** - If you decide
that you want to work
on a particular idea/company/product,
discuss it with us!
