# Ask Me Anything!

The purpose of the dwyl apprenticeship "AMA"
is for everyone in the team to get to know each other a bit.

Please clone this repository, create a new file `{your-github-username}.md`
copy the contents of `TEMPLATE.md`

in my case I ran the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/dwyl/apprenticeship.git && cd apprenticeship
cp ama/TEMPLATE.md ama/nelsonic.md
```
