# Ask Me _Anything_!

The purpose of the dwyl apprenticeship "AMA"
is for _everyone_ in the team to get to know each other a bit.

> Answering these questions is _not optional_,
it's a way for you to introduce yourself.
If you prefer not to share _specific_ details
(_e.g. names of past employers in your answer to Question 2.1_),
Make it generic. E.g. If you worked for McDonalds,
replace it with "fast food restaurant".
Don't worry, nobody from your _old_ job is going to read this.
And if they do, the will probably _thank_ you for
drawing attention to the areas for improvement.

## Step 1: Clone the Repository & Create your Answers File:

Please clone this repository, create a new file `{your-github-username}.md`
copy the contents of `TEMPLATE.md`

in my case I ran the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/dwyl/apprenticeship.git && cd apprenticeship
cp ama/TEMPLATE.md ama/nelsonic.md
```
## Step 2: Answer the AMA Questions in _your_ File

Once you have created your own "ama" answers file,
please answer the questions!
