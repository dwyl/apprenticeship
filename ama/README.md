## Step 1: Clone the Repository & Create your Answers File:

Please clone this repository, create a new file `{your-github-username}.md`
copy the contents of `TEMPLATE.md`

in my case I ran the following:

git clone https://github.com/dwyl/apprenticeship.git && cd apprenticeship
cp ama/TEMPLATE.md ama/nelsonic.md
```

Once you have created your own "ama" answers file, please answer the questions!
